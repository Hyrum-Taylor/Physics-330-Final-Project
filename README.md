# Physics 330 Final Project
 Foucault pendulum simulation

For this project, we are planning on modeling a Foucault pendulum

We feel like this is a good system to model because it is a non-linear
	system, it is something none of us have worked on before, and
	it is an interesting problem. In addition, it is a problem that
	can be complex enough for us to learn while solving it, while
	being simple enough that we can solve it in a reasonable amount
	of time
